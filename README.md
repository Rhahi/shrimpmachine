# shrimpmachine
A single-page Jekyll web page about the shrimp machine.

## What is it?

Räkmaskinen is a pun made from a mistake when I learned a word, räknemaskin.

It is a Swedish word for calculator. However, I mispronounced it as a räkmaskin, which becamse a shrimp machine.

I like sea critters, and this name stuck with me and I ended up making a page for it.
